# Accounting GUI app

## Unfinished
An app is currently unfinished

## Why?
I started learning Rust in summer 2024. As I progressed, I decided to build something high-level and useful for me. 
One process I wanted to improve was tracking my expenses, which I started at the beginning of 2024. I used the Notes app and Excel. Each month, I had to manually calculate sums and insert them to the spreadsheet. My first attempt to save me some time was a simple python script which would calculate everything for me, although
I still had to manually put summaries into excel. 

So I came up with a wonderful idea to create a GUI app that would save me 2-5 minutes every month. **TimeIsMoney** (the app name) should provide me with a simple way to receive and process data, then insert it into a spreadsheet. I thought that it wasn't enough, so I decided that this app should also provide me some statistics on my data stored in Excel. 

### Project Outcomes
After finishing the app, I expect to:
- Finally use Rust for something (though not low-level yet)
- Read a lot of documentation
- Finally have a test coverage
- Learn more about GUI libraries for Rust
- Become a better designer
- Prove that stats modules at university are not useless
- Gain more practice with data visualization
- And the most important!!! Save time on tasks I had to do manually
